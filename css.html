    <p>
      all Scripture is inspired by God and is useful to teach us what is true and to make us realize what is wrong in our lives. It corrects us when we are wrong and teaches us to do what is right. God uses it to prepare and equip his people to do every good work.

          Why is the name of the Bible the Bible?
        </h3>
        <p>
          The name Bible refers to the town in Lebanon called Biblos, now Jbeil. The town was known for producing papyrus - or rolls - for writing. The influence of the city was such that the word 'bible' means 'books' in Greek.

        <h3>
          All the numbers that appear in the Bible have a meaning
        </h3>
        <p>
          The Bible uses the numbers one to six as the basis for all the others. All the others have their essential meanings from the first six. The number 7 is the perfect number, but 8 is 7 + 1, i.e. a number that starts a new cycle.

          The number of the beast
        </h3>
        <p>
          Actually the number 666 is a mistranslation, and the real number of the devil - which, by the way, is a code for the name of the Roman emperor Nero - is 616.
